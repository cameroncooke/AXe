# Changelog

All notable changes to the AXe iOS testing framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Changed the IDB integration to consume an immutable full-SHA-pinned AXe fork instead of applying local patches during builds.
- Changed build and release validation to record Xcode build identifiers as provenance instead of requiring exact toolchain and runtime builds.
- Changed BGRA video streams to honor the requested `--fps` value consistently with the other stream formats instead of using an uncapped native frame rate.

### Fixed

- Fixed IDB framework builds failing on incomplete generated checkouts by replacing the cache with a clean clone.
- Fixed `make e2e` under Xcode 27 by rebuilding IDB frameworks with the selected toolchain, selecting the matching iOS 27 simulator, and launching Device Hub before running tests.
- Fixed simulator automation with Xcode 27 Beta 3 (27A5218g) while retaining Xcode 26 support by updating the IDB integration, selecting the compatible HID transport, and bootstrapping accessibility through Xcode's current private-framework path.
- Fixed `test-runner.sh` loading AXe's binary target frameworks with newer SwiftPM layouts while remaining compatible with Xcode 26.
- Fixed E2E test hangs by resolving the `axe` executable path before `swift test` starts instead of invoking SwiftPM from inside test cases.
- Fixed release archives embedding AppleDouble (`._*`) metadata files that broke strict Gatekeeper verification of the bundled frameworks by sanitizing staged payloads and excluding filesystem metadata from zip and tar packaging.
- Fixed `build.sh` blocking on an interactive git pager during IDB checkout verification when run in a terminal.
- Fixed Xcode 26 E2E setup and managed IDB cache recovery, including incomplete custom `IDB_CHECKOUT_DIR` checkouts created by AXe.
- Fixed HID broker crash and simulator-reboot recovery so concurrent cold starts spawn one broker, stale sessions are replaced before sending the first touch request, ambiguous touch requests are never replayed, and broker identity follows the selected Xcode.
- Fixed runtime failures printing raw error implementation details and internal simulator terminology instead of actionable, user-facing messages.

## [v1.7.1] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added AxePlayground alert, sheet, context menu, modal navigation, and long-scroll fixtures for UI automation regression coverage.

## [v1.7.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added `axe slider --id/--label --value 0...100` for selector-based slider setting with orientation-aware HID dragging and AXValue tolerance verification/failure reporting.
- Added `axe drag --start-x/--start-y --end-x/--end-y` for raw point-to-point low-level HID drag validation using explicit touch move events.

### Changed

- Changed `axe slider` to use the shared composite low-level HID drag path with AXValue tolerance verification instead of retrying with correction gestures.

### Fixed

- Fixed `describe-ui` and selector-based `tap --label` exposing and activating real SwiftUI `TabView` tab items, navigation search fields, toolbar segmented picker items, and generated navigation back buttons from the CoreSimulator accessibility bridge. Also fixed selector decoding when the accessibility tree contains numeric `AXValue` fields such as sliders.
- Fixed `tap`, `touch`, `swipe`, and matching batch steps dispatching logical UI coordinates directly to FBSimulatorHIDEvent without landscape rotation or letterbox correction, causing interactions to land in the wrong location in rotated landscape simulators and portrait-hardware landscape-only apps. AXe now detects the simulator UI orientation automatically instead of requiring callers to pass landscape flags ([#5](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/issues/5) by [@Nitewriter](https://github.com/Nitewriter))
- Fixed selector-based `tap` and batch tap steps so UIKit `UISwitch` and SwiftUI `Toggle` controls can be activated reliably, including when a matched row or label contains a single switch/toggle control. Added `--tap-style` so switch/toggle taps can use physical touch automatically while normal taps keep the simulator `tapAt` path by default ([#46](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/46)).
- Fixed element comparison in `AccessibilityTargetResolver` to prevent distinct elements with the same type and frame but lacking labels/values from being incorrectly identified as identical during ancestor tree traversal.

## [v1.6.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- Added `--value` targeting for `tap`, allowing elements to be matched by their accessibility value in addition to `--id` and `--label`. Added `--element-type` filtering to narrow matches by element type (e.g., button, text field) ([#40](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/40) by [@andresdefi](https://github.com/andresdefi)).
- Added `--wait-timeout` and `--poll-interval` options to `tap` for waiting until a matching element appears before tapping ([#40](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/40) by [@andresdefi](https://github.com/andresdefi)).

### Fixed

- Fixed `describe-ui` to expose and implement the documented `--point` option in command help and runtime behavior ([#38](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/issues/38))

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Added `batch` command for executing ordered multi-step interaction workflows in a single invocation, with sequential execution that supports multi-screen flows, built-in `sleep` delays, accessibility caching, and configurable text submission strategies ([#25](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/25)). See [BATCHING.md](BATCHING.md).
- Added `axe init` command to install, uninstall, or print the AXe skill for AI clients (`claude`, `agents`) or a custom destination ([#25](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/25)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Homebrew installation on Intel Macs by producing architecture-specific release artifacts ([#27](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/27), [#21](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/issues/21))
- Fixed `tap --label` resolving ambiguous matches by preferring actionable elements over read-only ones ([#28](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/28))

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- AxePlayground Touch Control now shows long-press count and last long-press coordinates, making gesture automation easier to validate.

### Fixed

- Improved long-press reliability for `axe touch`: `--down --up --delay` now consistently behaves like a real press-and-hold gesture.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-01-28

- Add `key-combo` command for atomic modifier+key presses (e.g., Cmd+A, Cmd+Shift+Z) Thanks to @jpsim for the contribution!
